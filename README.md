# Project 1 Plan
========================
## Cornell Bird Lab
### [eBird API 2.0 documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59)
* Uses Cornell bird lab data of bird observations from around the world
* Recommend scoping down to Texas and only observations within a specific time period (ie last week) b/c database is HUGE
* Could merge with weather data from open weather map
* Would make for fun visualizations fo number of bird sightings and different bird species
