# Project 1 Plan
========================
## Cornell Bird Lab
### [eBird API 2.0 documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59)
* Uses Cornell bird lab data of bird observations from around the world
* Recommend scoping down to Texas and only observations within a specific time period (ie last week) b/c database is HUGE
* Could merge with weather data from open weather map
* Would make for fun visualizations fo number of bird sightings and different bird species


----------------------
### Issues:
1. DAVID - Notable birds in region - try Texas or Austin (Houston!!) -- pick a few wildlife refuges / on the coast / national seashore / etc

2. BRAD - State by state total number of observations during two or more different time periods -- maybe bar chart by season? or plotly map of states in US with total # observations?

3. JUGAL - Historical weather -- free from NOAA API (requires GIT header) or OpenWeatherMap 

4. STEPHEN - Endangered species historical search -- "data deficiency as a proxy for endangered bird species"

5. RACHEL - Just for fun: bird sightings on historic days

6. STEPHEN - Find a list of endagered / threatened / least concern birds & try to merge with a group of sightings

7. MARIA - Migratory patterns -- pick one species, find sightings throughout the year -- plot counts in different regions (seasonally?)


----------------------
### Timeline:
* Tue 22nd - Plan & assign "issues" (topics/questions)
* Thurs 24th - Check in on initial issue attempts / problem solving -- **first attempt at merging!** (we record)
* Sat 26th - Cross-talk -- some issues --> putting individual pieces into defined functions (keeps them separate in the master code?)
* Tue 29th - Double check all project requirements met -- readdress/fix as needed
* Thur 1st - Making into a story / polishing / ready for presentation / practice
* Sat 3rd - PROJECT DUE! PRESENTATION
