# Project 1 - Ideas
========================
## Cornell Bird Lab
### [eBird API 2.0 documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59)
* Uses Cornell bird lab data of bird observations from around the world
* Recommend scoping down to Texas and only observations within a specific time period (ie last week) b/c database is HUGE
* Could merge with weather data from open weather map
* Would make for fun visualizations fo number of bird sightings and different bird species

-----------------------
## Non-Profit Tax Filings
### [ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer API](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api)
* Uses nonprofit tax returns processed by the IRS from 2012-2018
* Lists total filings as well as non-profit category (ie eduction, health, religion, etc)
* Could merge with income data and show non-profit filings vs avg income for regions (by zip code? by state?)
* Could map per capita non-profit filings by state
* Could chart how filings for different non-profit categories have changed over time
